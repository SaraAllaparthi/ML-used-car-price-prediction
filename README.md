# Car Price Prediction Using Stacking Ensemble

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict used car prices using a stacking ensemble method. It leverages multiple algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
  - `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, and `catboost` for advanced regression algorithms
  - `optuna` for hyperparameter optimization
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing information about used cars, including features such as:
- Model
- Year
- Price
- Transmission type
- Mileage
- Fuel type
- Tax
- MPG (Miles Per Gallon)
- Engine size
- Brand

The dataset can be loaded from the provided URLs in the notebook.
